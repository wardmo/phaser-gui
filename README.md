# phaser-gui
implement a gui that works as a command builder for the phaser command line tool


# phaser-command-line directory
the contents of this directory are the binary files needed to run the phaser command line tool.  
if you call `.\PhaserCommandLine.exe` from the terminal, it should bring up the help dialog.  
start by adding a button to our gui for each parameter.
